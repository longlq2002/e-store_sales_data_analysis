##### The project conducted an analysis of sales data for a year from an electronic retail chain in the United States in 2019. The project aims to analyze and answer five main questions: (1) What was the best month for sales and how much revenue was generated that month? (2) Which city had the highest number of sales? (3) What is the optimal time to display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer purchases? (4) Which product had the highest sales? Why do you think it outperformed the others? (5) Which products are most frequently sold together? 


The results indicate that the end of the year, specifically the fourth quarter of 2019, was the period with the highest sales profit, reaching a total of $11,549,773.42 (accounting for 33.49% of the total sales profit for the year). Among these, the month of December stood out as the highest-profit month within the fourth quarter, with sales totaling $4,613,443.34, constituting 39.4% of the fourth quarter's sales revenue in 2019.

The reason why sales activities in the last 3 months of the year earn the most profit is because this time is associated with many Western activities and holidays such as Halloween (31/10); Thanksgiving Day (5th of the 4th week of November); Black Friday in the US (6th of the 4th week of November) ... Therefore, sales activities at this time will become more exciting due to the preferential purchase policies offered by e-businesses continuously to stimulate shopping demand. In addition, around the end of December, there are 2 almost largest holidays of the US, Christmas (25/12) and New Year's Day (1/1), so the shopping demand of customers will increase for many different purposes, leading to the highest profit of December in sales profit in 2019.
